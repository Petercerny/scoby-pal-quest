## Module 1: Introduction to Kombucha
Kombucha is a fermented tea drink made with sweetened tea and a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast). During fermentation, the SCOBY converts sugar into acids, gases, and trace alcohol, creating a fizzy, tangy beverage with potential probiotic benefits.

## Module 2: The SCOBY
### The Heart of Kombucha
- A living culture of bacteria and yeast.  
- Grows as a cellulose mat on the surface of the tea.  
- Converts sugar into acids and carbonation.  
- Needs a clean, slightly acidic environment to thrive.  
- Can be stored in a ‚ÄúSCOBY hotel‚Äù when not brewing.

## Module 3: Brewing Process
### Ingredients
- Tea: black, green, oolong, or blends (avoid oils/flavored teas).  
- Sugar: white cane sugar is best.  
- Water: filtered or spring.  
- Starter Tea: mature kombucha from a previous batch.  

### First Fermentation (F1)
1. Brew sweet tea, let it cool.  
2. Add SCOBY + starter tea.  
3. Cover with breathable cloth.  
4. Ferment 7‚Äì14 days (shorter = sweeter, longer = tangier).  

### Second Fermentation (F2)
1. Remove SCOBY and some starter tea for next batch.  
2. Bottle kombucha with fruits, herbs, or spices.  
3. Seal tightly for 2‚Äì7 days to carbonate.  
4. Refrigerate to stop fermentation.

## Module 4: Flavoring & Recipes
### Get Creative with Flavors
- Fruits: berries, citrus, mango.  
- Herbs & Spices: ginger, mint, cinnamon.  
- Sample Blends: Lemon + Lavender, Ginger + Turmeric.  

üí° *Tip: Strain before drinking if you prefer a smooth kombucha.*

## Module 5: Safety & Troubleshooting
### Safety Practices
- Sanitize jars, bottles, and utensils.  
- Keep pH below 4.6.  
- Use clean hands when handling SCOBY.  

### Common Issues
- **Mold:** Dry, fuzzy, white/green/black/blue spots ‚Üí discard batch & SCOBY.  
- **No carbonation:** Check bottle seal or add more sugar/fruit.  
- **Too sour:** Shorten fermentation time.  
- **Too sweet:** Extend fermentation time.

## Module 6: Health Benefits & Considerations
- Contains probiotics, antioxidants, organic acids.  
- May support digestion and gut health.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not suitable for everyone (pregnant people, children, immunocompromised should consult a doctor).  
- Contains caffeine and trace alcohol.

## Module 7: Advanced Brewing
- **Continuous Brewing:** Tap from a vessel while replenishing tea.  
- **Alternative Teas:** White, oolong, pu-erh.  
- **Sugar Alternatives:** Honey (jun kombucha), coconut sugar, maple syrup.  
- **Kombucha Vinegar:** Over-fermented kombucha for salad dressings & marinades.

- Originated in Northeast China ~220 BCE.  
- Spread to Japan, Russia, and Europe.  
- Popularized in the West in the 20th century.  
- Now part of a global craft beverage movement.
